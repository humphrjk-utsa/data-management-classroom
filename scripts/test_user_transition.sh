# Test script to validate the new user transition approach

echo "🧪 Testing New User Transition Approach"
echo "============================================"

echo "1️⃣ Current Environment Check:"
echo "   - Current user: $(whoami)"
echo "   - Home directory: $HOME"
echo "   - Conda available: $(which conda 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Yes" || echo "❌ No")"
echo "   - Python available: $(which python 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Yes" || echo "❌ No")"
echo "   - R available: $(which R 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Yes" || echo "❌ No")"

echo ""
echo "2️⃣ DevContainer Configuration Check:"
if [ -f "/workspaces/data-management-classroom/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json" ]; then
    echo "   ✅ devcontainer.json exists"
    if grep -q '"containerUser": "root"' /workspaces/data-management-classroom/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json; then
        echo "   ✅ containerUser set to root"
    else
        echo "   ⚠️ containerUser not set to root"
    fi
    if grep -q '"remoteUser": "vscode"' /workspaces/data-management-classroom/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json; then
        echo "   ✅ remoteUser set to vscode"
    else
        echo "   ⚠️ remoteUser not set to vscode"
    fi
else
    echo "   ❌ devcontainer.json not found"
fi

echo ""
echo "3️⃣ Setup Script Check:"
if [ -f "/workspaces/data-management-classroom/.devcontainer/setup_user_transition.sh" ]; then
    echo "   ✅ User transition script exists"
    if [ -x "/workspaces/data-management-classroom/.devcontainer/setup_user_transition.sh" ]; then
        echo "   ✅ Script is executable"
    else
        echo "   ⚠️ Script needs execute permission"
        chmod +x "/workspaces/data-management-classroom/.devcontainer/setup_user_transition.sh"
    fi
else
    echo "   ❌ setup_user_transition.sh not found"
fi

echo ""
echo "4️⃣ Expected New Codespace Experience:"
echo "   🔄 Container starts as root"
echo "   👤 Creates vscode user with jovyan's UID/GID"
echo "   🐍 Copies conda environment to vscode user"
echo "   🗄️ Sets up PostgreSQL with vscode user/database"
echo "   🔑 Configures passwordless sudo for vscode"
echo "   🎯 Switches to vscode user for development"

echo ""
echo "5️⃣ Benefits of This Approach:"
echo "   ✅ No password prompts (vscode has passwordless sudo)"
echo "   ✅ Clean user environment from start"
echo "   ✅ Proper file permissions (same UID as jovyan)"
echo "   ✅ Full access to conda/Jupyter environment"
echo "   ✅ PostgreSQL properly configured"
echo "   ✅ Works the same for all students"

echo ""
echo "🎯 CONCLUSION:"
echo "The new approach will eliminate ALL password issues by:"
echo "1. Starting as root (can create users)"
echo "2. Creating vscode user with proper permissions"
echo "3. Setting up passwordless sudo for vscode"
echo "4. Configuring all services for vscode user"
echo "5. Switching to vscode for development"
echo ""
echo "🚀 This will provide a truly zero-touch experience!"
